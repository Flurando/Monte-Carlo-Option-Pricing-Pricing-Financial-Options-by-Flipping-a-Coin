to set up the environment, run ~./.init-env~ in this directory
it would drop you in a shell environment same as mine
with current working directory permissions preserved

upon finish, run ~./q2-sim-plot.scm~ to generate the two simulated trajetories as png in images folder for question (2)

run ~./q3-sim-calc.scm~ to calculate the morte carlo estimation
(by default, 30000+ rounds of calculation, so...)

run ~./q4-sim-vary.scm~ to calculate the fourth question
this would take a long time as there are 20*30000 rounds!
