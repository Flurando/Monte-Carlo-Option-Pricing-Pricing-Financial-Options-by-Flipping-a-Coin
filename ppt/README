plans
1. impress.js
the coolest presentation tool using CSS3D frontend tech
downside is the requirement of latest browser support
2. skribilo
while I like its structure and feeling
but it is really hard to use, with kind of poor document and a very inactive community
I would not use this because from the document I found no way of adding css or equivalence
3. org beamer
Legacy solution, my pick as a last resort before deadline
4. MS PowerPoint / Google Slides
I would not use them, but teammates might, and accepted as long as they could do it on their own

final
only impress.js solution is finished.
